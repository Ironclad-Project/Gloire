## Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?

Please open a pull request with your feature! It is fine to open a pull request
without anything to show yet as to make sure that the feature is diseared and
appropiate, before comitting to any work.

Optionally, you can join one of the

as Gloire falls under the Ironclad project umbrella, where we can discuss these
details as well as do mentouring on any issues regarding getting the work going.
