## Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?

Please open a pull request at our [Codeberg repository](https://codeberg.org/Ironclad/Gloire).
It is fine to open a pull request without anything to show yet as to make sure
that the feature is desired and appropiate, before comitting to any work.

Optionally, you can join one of the
[Ironclad communities](https://ironclad-os.org/community.html),
as Gloire falls under the Ironclad project umbrella, where we can discuss these
details as well as do mentouring on any issues regarding getting the work going.
