# This command is executed after a succesful login.
# You can place the %session and %theme variables to handle launching of
# specific commands in .xinitrc depending on chosen session and slim theme.
# Ensure that the command handles an empty %session, as that is the default
#
# NOTE: if your system does not have bash you need to adjust the command
# according to your preferred shell, e.g. for freebsd use:
# login_cmd           exec /bin/sh - ~/.xinitrc %session
login_cmd           exec /bin/bash -login ~/.xinitrc %session

# Commands executed when starting and exiting a session.
# They can be used for registering a X11 session with
# sessreg. You can use the %user variable
#
# sessionstart_cmd	some command
# sessionstop_cmd	some command
# sessionstart_cmd	/usr/bin/sessreg -a -l "$DISPLAY" %user
# sessionstop_cmd     /usr/bin/sessreg -d -l "$DISPLAY" %user

# Start in daemon mode. Valid values: yes | no
# Note that this can be overridden by the command line options "-d" and "-n"
daemon	yes

# Available sessions:
# The current chosen session name replaces %session in the login_cmd
# above, so your login command can handle different sessions.
# If no session is chosen (via F1), %session will be an empty string. This
# allows the script to handle default in a user-specific manner, if desired.
# See the xinitrc.sample file shipped with slim sources.
#sessions            xfce4,icewm-session,wmaker,blackbox

# Alternatively, read available sessions from the contents of a
# directory.  The directory can contain either executable scripts,
# or xsessions .desktop files.  In the case of .desktop files, the name
# displayed is the Name= value and the string substutited in place of
# %session is the Exec= value -- note that this may provide a full
